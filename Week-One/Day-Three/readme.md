## Overview

In programming, a pipeline is a mechanism where the output of one stage becomes the input of another.

Each stage in the pipeline performs a specific task, and the data is transformed or manipulated as it moves through these stages. This concept is commonly used to design systems where tasks are broken down into smaller, interconnected components, creating a streamlined and organized workflow.
