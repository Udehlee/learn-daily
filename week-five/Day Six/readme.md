SQL DATATYPES(1)

SQL Datatypes define the type of data/value a database column can store or process.

A typical example is when you want to store information about a product. You need to specify the datatype each field(productID , Name, Price) holds.

Datatypes in SQL includes:

- CHAR  , Fixed-length character strings. It is used when all the variables are of the same length.
- VARCHAR(size): Variable-length character strings. here, you declare the max-length.

-DECIMAL(precision,scale) , a datatype that allows you store numbers with a specific precision and scale.
