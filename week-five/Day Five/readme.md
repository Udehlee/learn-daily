## overview

   

learned the Model-View-Controller design pattern today.

It is a software design pattern that seperates an application into different components( Model,View,Controller) where each component has thier thier own purpose,

-Controller
 - The Controller handles the request sent by the client
 - Interacts with the Model by fetching data from it
 - Updates the View with the data.
 - gets the data presentation from the View


- Model
 - The Model handles the database interaction 
 -also, handles the data logic
 - 

-View
 - Handles the data presentation


This separation makes the codebase easier to manage and maintain
