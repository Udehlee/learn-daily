 A hash table is a data structure that associates keys with their generated hash codes(values). Its like having a specific location (index) for the keys( likely a string).
 When you input a key into the hash table, a hash function turns it into a hash code, which then becomes the location where that key is stored.
 The hash table has three primary methods, namely,

- insert ( add key-value pairs)
- search ( find values associated with keys)
- delete (remove key-value pairs)
